# Sword-Master-Mix-Up
In this project, I tackled the "Sword Master Mix-Up" challenge. 
The backstory revolves around two legendary swordsmasters, Liechtenauer and Musashi, 
who accidentally mixed up their swords at a cosplay event. 

The task was to develop a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to manage and assign these swords to the respective masters.

The main functionalities include randomly displaying sword images, showing/hiding a button row when hovering over the sword image,
and updating a counter when assigning swords to Liechtenauer or Musashi. 
The challenge also involved fetching sword data from a simulated REST API using JavaScript's fetch method.

For an extra touch and achieving a higher grade, I implemented additional features. 
The sword details fetched from the API are displayed in a "result" div with information about the outcome of each action. Moreover, when a sword is correctly assigned, an image of the sword is dynamically added to the corresponding master's section.

The project not only aimed for functionality but also emphasized a clean and visually appealing layout.
The code ensures a seamless user experience without any console errors.
